# My first Milestone Project

    When I was prompted for this project to create a browser game, I was immediately reminded of my two sons, adults now, as little boys, laying on the floor and playing a card game to test their memory.  Was this perhaps too simple? When I thought of bringing it to the screen, I thought of many of the lessons from class, and I knew I would need to create a board of sorts, and divide it for all the cards, and make the cards themselves, and randomly generate a pattern.  I thought of the styling and the interaction of the javaScript and the DOM.  I thought that it was indeed something that I could do, and get it done in the time alloted, and maybe, I could even tweak it enough for it to be fairly polished by the time I needed to submit it.  Thanks for the memories...

# My First Milestone Project

    We were prompted to make a browser game for our first Milestone project, and I instantly thought of my two sons, adults now, as little boys spreading out a simple card game on the floor of our home.  The idea was to test your memory, and the colorful cards with animal shapes seemed like just the thing for this browser game. 

    ## How It Related to What I have Learned 
    I had to use my knowledge of HTML and CSS to get a board on the screen and populate it with images.  I had to use my  knowledge of javaScript to shuffle the cards and randomize them onto the board.  The cards had to be able to flip and stay flipped when matched, or return to their begining position if not. Finally, it had to have an end state.
